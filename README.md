## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python 3.7+)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern gradients and animations
- **API Integration**: n8n webhooks for real-time processing
- **Design**: Clean, professional interface with smooth animations

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- n8n workflows running locally with active webhooks
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nraitschew/shopping_query_analyzer.git
cd shopping_query_analyzer
```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. **Ensure n8n workflows are running**
   - The application requires two n8n webhook endpoints to be active
   - Update webhook URLs in `app.py` if needed

2. **Start the Flask server**
```bash
python app.py
```

3. **Open your browser**
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Webhook URLs
The application uses two n8n webhook endpoints configured in `app.py`:

```python
QUERY_EVALUATOR_WEBHOOK = "http://0.0.0.0:5678/webhook/5063a70b-f51b-4a3a-b4ca-414143e36845"
LLM_COMPARISON_WEBHOOK = "http://0.0.0.0:5678/webhook/553c16ba-1923-464a-a318-878470bb24da"
```

**Note for WSL users**: Update these URLs based on your setup:
- **WSL**: Use the gateway IP (run `ip route | grep default` to find it)
- **Local Windows**: Use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
- **Docker**: Use the container's IP address
- **Remote server**: Use the server's IP or domain

## üí° Usage Guide

### Using the Query Evaluator
1. Navigate to the Query Evaluator from the home page
2. Enter any shopping query (e.g., "wireless headphones for running")
3. Click "Analyze Query" to get instant feedback
4. Review scores, suggestions, and missing information
5. Use the improved query suggestion for better search results

### Using the LLM Comparison
1. Navigate to LLM Comparison from the home page
2. Enter a shopping query you want both AIs to answer
3. Click "Compare AI Responses" to see side-by-side analysis
4. Review detailed scores and recommendations
5. Use insights to choose the best AI for your shopping needs

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Webhook Connection Issues
- Verify n8n is running: Check if you can access n8n's web interface
- Test webhook directly: Use curl or Postman to test the webhook endpoints
- Check firewall: Ensure ports are open for webhook communication

### WSL-Specific Issues
- Find correct host IP: Run `ip route | grep default` in WSL
- Update app.py with the correct IP address
- Ensure Windows firewall allows WSL connections

### General Issues
- **Port already in use**: Change Flask port in `app.py` (default: 5000)
- **Module not found**: Reinstall dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **No response from webhooks**: Check n8n workflow execution logs
- **Browser console errors**: Open developer tools for detailed error messages
